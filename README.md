# Hypergraph AI Map

This is a starter application generated by TypeSync from Hypergraph. It provides a fully-functional React application based on a defined data schema.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 22.0 or higher
- **pnpm**: Version 10.0 or higher (`npm install -g pnpm`)

## Installation Guide

These steps will guide you through setting up a local development environment.

### 1. Install the Hypergraph CLI

The Hypergraph CLI provides the tools needed to scaffold your application.

```bash
pnpm install -g @graphprotocol/hypergraph-cli@latest
```

After installation, you may need to approve build scripts for certain dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm approve-builds -g
```

When prompted, use the spacebar to select the following packages, then press Enter:
- `@tailwindcss/oxide`
- `better-sqlite3`
- `esbuild`

### 2. Configure Git

The scaffolding tool clones a template from GitHub. By default, it may try to use SSH, which requires a configured SSH key. To avoid permission issues, configure Git to use HTTPS for GitHub connections:

```bash
git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:
```

### 3. Launch TypeSync

TypeSync is a visual tool for defining your data schema. Launch it with:

```bash
hg typesync --open
```

This will start a server and open the TypeSync studio in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Note:** On some systems, the `hg` command may be associated with Mercurial. If you encounter issues, it might be due to a `PATH` conflict. The command from the Hypergraph CLI should take precedence.

### 4. Scaffold Your Application

In the TypeSync Studio:

1.  Give your application a name (e.g., `my-awesome-app`) and a description.
2.  Use the visual editor to define your data model. For this example, you can select the "Academic Field" type.
3.  Click **"Generate App"**.

TypeSync will create a new directory with your application's files.

## Running Your Application

Once the application is generated, navigate into its directory and start the development server.

```bash
cd <your-app-name>
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
