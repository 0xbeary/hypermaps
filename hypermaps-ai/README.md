# üó∫Ô∏è Hypergraph AI Map

A revolutionary collaborative AI conversation mapping platform built on Next.js and powered by Hypergraph technology. Create, visualize, and share AI conversations as interactive knowledge maps that can be collaborated on privately and published on-chain for the world to explore.

## üöÄ What This Project Does

Hypergraph AI Map transforms traditional linear AI conversations into dynamic, visual knowledge graphs. Instead of scrolling through endless chat logs, you can:

- **Visualize Conversations**: See AI interactions as connected nodes in a flow-based interface
- **Branch Conversations**: Create multiple conversation paths from any point
- **Add Context**: Insert comments and annotations anywhere in your conversation map
- **Collaborate Privately**: Work together on the same conversation map in real-time
- **Publish & Share**: Publish your maps on-chain for others to discover and fork

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Next.js Migration from Vite
This project was migrated from Vite to Next.js to leverage:
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Better SEO and initial load performance
- **API Routes**: Seamless backend integration for AI services
- **App Router**: Modern routing with layout support
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, font loading, and bundle splitting

### Hypergraph as the Data Layer
[Hypergraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/hypergraph) serves as our decentralized data store:
- **Entity-Based Storage**: Messages, comments, and conversations are stored as entities
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes propagate instantly across all collaborators
- **Cryptographic Security**: All data is cryptographically signed and verified
- **Offline-First**: Works without internet, syncs when reconnected
- **Version Control**: Built-in history and conflict resolution

## ü§ù Private Collaboration

### Secure Team Workspaces
- **Encrypted Spaces**: Each project exists in a private, encrypted hypergraph space
- **Access Control**: Only invited collaborators can view and edit
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes from teammates instantly
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic merging of concurrent edits
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of who changed what and when

### Collaboration Features
- **Live Cursors**: See where teammates are working in real-time
- **Comments & Annotations**: Add context without disrupting the conversation flow
- **Branching Conversations**: Multiple people can explore different conversation paths
- **Merge Capabilities**: Combine the best parts of different conversation branches

## üåê On-Chain Publishing

### Decentralized Knowledge Sharing
When you're ready to share your conversation map with the world:

1. **Publish to Chain**: Your map becomes a permanent, immutable record
2. **Discoverability**: Others can find and explore your published maps
3. **Forkable**: Anyone can create their own version of your map
4. **Attribution**: Original creators are always credited
5. **Monetization**: Optional: Set fees for commercial use of your maps

### Benefits of On-Chain Publishing
- **Permanent Archive**: Your knowledge maps are preserved forever
- **Global Access**: Anyone in the world can access and learn from your work
- **Provenance**: Cryptographic proof of authorship and creation date
- **Composability**: Maps can reference and build upon each other
- **Incentive Alignment**: Creators can be rewarded for valuable contributions

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start creating your first AI conversation map.

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file with your configuration:

```env
# AI Provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Hypergraph Configuration
HYPERGRAPH_SPACE_ID=your_space_id

# Database (optional - for caching)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```
